\begin{abstract}
   The ABSTRACT is to be in fully-justified italicized text, at the top
   of the left-hand column, below the author and affiliation
   information. Use the word ``Abstract'' as the title, in 12-point
   Times, boldface type, centered relative to the column, initially
   capitalized. The abstract is to be in 10-point, single-spaced type.
   Leave two blank lines after the Abstract, then begin the main text.
   Look at previous CVPR abstracts to get a feel for style and length.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

\section{State of the art}
We should write a few lines about \cite{theis_lossy_2017} (which model we used), \cite{sajjadi_enhancenet:_2016} (gave us ideas for the loss functions) and also about \cite{gatys_texture_2015} in which texture loss was first introduced.

\section{Model}

Explain our archictecture and all the small tricks we used (custom derivatives, all this stuff). 

\section{Experiments}

Which dataset did we use, why and how ?

\section{Results}

Probably a bunch of nice images showing how great our autoencoder performs.

\section{Discussion} % Conclusion ?

What did we do ? Are our results good ? What could we do next if we were not writing this report less than four days before the deadline ?
